# Bourbon Tasting Notes & Recommendation App

Welcome to my repository! This project is a Streamlit app designed for bourbon enthusiasts to track their tasting notes and receive personalized bourbon recommendations.

## Project Overview

This app allows users to record their bourbon tasting experiences and suggests bourbons to try based on their own preferences, similar users' tastes, and curated tasting notes from distilleries and popular bourbon review sites.

## Inspiration

As someone who grew up in Tennessee with limited exposure to bourbon outside of Jack Danielâ€™s, moving to Kentucky opened my eyes to the rich bourbon culture. Starting my bourbon journey, I realized how diverse the flavor profiles are. A friend challenged me to write down tasting notes for each bourbon I tried, and this project was born to serve as a digital tasting log and recommendation engine for bourbons with similar profiles.

## Technical Details

The app is built in Python using Streamlit to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface. User data and tasting notes are stored in a Supabase database. I am actively collecting tasting notes from various distillery websites and bourbon review sources to create a robust dataset. This dataset will be used to train and deploy a recommendation model that suggests bourbons tailored to each user's taste.

## Future Plans

- User authentication and profile management through SupaBase
- Enhanced recommendation algorithms leveraging collaborative filtering and natural language processing  
- Integration of additional data sources for richer tasting notes
